# Substantive Work Protocol

This is the canonical planning and execution workflow for substantive work in a
repo that vendors `agent-protocols/`.

Use it for any non-trivial feature, fix, refactor, migration, or cross-repo
change.

If the workstream is intentionally proposal-only and stops before
implementation, use the [Proposal protocol](proposal-protocol.md). Proposal
capture does not automatically require the full substantive artifact set.

## When To Use This

This protocol is the default when any of these are true:

- the change spans multiple files or modules
- the work has meaningful product, runtime, or security risk
- the work needs more than one reviewable implementation slice
- the work crosses repos or ownership boundaries
- the user asked for an epic, rollout, or non-trivial implementation plan

For tiny, single-slice changes that do not meet the bar above, use the
[Minor work protocol](minor-work-protocol.md) instead. For substantive work,
use this protocol unless there is a very good reason not to.

## Core Rules

1. Every new feature, functionality change, or fix starts on its own branch.
2. Keep the integration branch worktree clean and up to date with origin before
   creating the branch. The examples in this package assume `main`; if the repo
   uses another trunk branch, record that explicitly in the plan and the
   checks.
3. Every substantive branch should have its own dedicated worktree. Do not
   implement multiple active substantive streams in the same checkout.
4. If the work spans repos, create a matching branch pair and keep each repo in
   its own worktree.
5. Break the work into an ordered sequence of gated mini-plans instead of one
   giant plan.
6. Only one phase may be actively implemented at a time.
7. Do not advance until the current phase exit gate passes.
8. Do not call work complete from narrative judgement alone. Completion must be
   backed by the phase checker and the documented gate.
9. Merge to the repo’s primary integration branch only after acceptance and
   final-green closure.
10. Treat live git and worktree state as authoritative. Durable docs should
   mirror that state, not override it.
11. Proposal-only slices need only the durable artifacts that will still be
    useful after review. Use the proposal protocol to decide what survives,
    and keep temporary ledgers or inventories disposable by default.
12. For implementation work, a final `ready for review`, `complete`, or
    equivalent result requires a clean git checkpoint: `git status
    --porcelain --untracked-files=all` must be empty, `HEAD` must be ahead of
    the recorded baseline, and the final answer or completion record must
    include branch, commit, pushed: yes/no, and worktree_clean: true/false.
    A dirty worktree at final response is a failed gate, not a degraded
    completion.

## Lifecycle States

Use these meanings consistently:

- Pending means a proposal record is ready on `main`, but substantive implementation has not begun.
- Active means substantive implementation has begun and is not yet complete.
- Completed implementation means the work landed on `main`, so the proposal is no longer active.
- Discarded or superseded means the outcome was captured durably and the live
  branch or worktree should be removed instead of lingering as ambiguous truth.

## Artifact Economy

Substantive work should preserve the smallest durable artifact set that proves
the work can be reviewed, resumed, or rolled back.

The normal durable minimum is:

- one concise plan
- one machine-checkable manifest while phases are active

Add a completion log, companion notes, proposal logs, pending ADRs, or mirrors
only when they carry information that is not already clear from the plan,
commit history, tests, or final review notes.

Temporary ledgers, inventories, tracking manifests, and scratch notes should
start in `docs/temp/` or another repo-approved temporary location. At closeout,
fold any lasting evidence into the plan, ADR, history note, or commit message,
then delete the temporary files.

## Canonical Artifact Set

Substantive work should use these artifacts.

### 1. Durable plan doc

Store the durable workstream plan in `docs/plans/`.

If the repo uses the optional `docs/plans/cross-repo/` extension and the work
requires coordinated implementation or acceptance across multiple repos, keep
the canonical plan there instead of in the local-only buckets.

The plan should record:

- the goal
- the baseline branch or commit
- the branch name for the work
- the ordered phases
- the write scope
- the validation and exit gates

### 2. Phase manifest

Store a machine-checkable manifest next to the plan. The recommended suffix is
`.plan.toml`.

A manifest is a phase-gate file paired with a durable plan. A manifest is not
automatically a proposal.

The manifest is the fail-closed source of truth for whether a phase is actually
done.

### 3. Optional completion log

Use an append-only completion log when the evidence is too detailed or
multi-stage to live cleanly in the plan or final review notes. For small
substantive slices, a short closeout section in the plan or commit can be
enough.

A completion log, when used, should capture:

- phase evidence that actually passed
- important SHAs, merges, pushes, and cleanup actions
- remaining work after the finished slice

### 4. Proposal protocol when implementation is intentionally deferred

If the workstream stops at a durable proposal rather than implementation,
follow the [Proposal protocol](proposal-protocol.md) for right-sized durable
capture instead of creating a full implementation artifact bundle.

### 5. Optional per-phase notes

If a phase is large, give it a short companion markdown note near the durable
plan. Keep those notes in `docs/plans/`, not in runtime procedure folders.

### 6. Repo-local mirrors only when needed

If one repo or product owns the canonical plan, other repos should point back
to it and add thin local notes only when they genuinely need companion
guidance.

### 7. Temporary docs go in `docs/temp/` first

If a markdown note is useful during execution but is not one of the durable
artifacts required by this protocol, create it under `docs/temp/` and follow
the [Temp doc protocol](temp-doc-protocol.md).

Before closing the workstream, review the temp docs, preserve any durable
content in the appropriate long-lived surface, and then delete the temp docs.

### 8. Placement heuristic for local versus cross-repo plans

Use the default local taxonomy when one repo can own implementation,
validation, and acceptance.

Use `docs/plans/cross-repo/` only when completion or acceptance depends on
coordinated work across 2+ repos.

Another repo being referenced for context does not make a plan cross-repo by
itself.

If a local plan later expands into coordinated multi-repo work, supersede it
or promote it into the orchestration repo under `docs/plans/cross-repo/`.

## Phase Structure

Each phase should be small enough to fit in one working context window and one
reviewable change slice.

Every phase should declare:

- `Goal`
- `Write scope`
- `Dependencies`
- `Checks`
- `Negative assertions`
- `Required docs or ledger updates`
- `Exit gate`

### Checks

Checks prove that the phase landed. Examples:

- targeted tests
- focused validation commands
- file or route existence checks
- content assertions in docs or config

### Negative Assertions

Negative assertions prevent partial migration from being presented as complete.
Examples:

- an old compatibility surface is no longer authoritative
- an obsolete path is gone
- a stale branch name is no longer documented as current

If a phase only proves what is present and never proves what is gone, the gate
is usually too weak.

## Standard Execution Loop

For substantive work, follow this loop every time:

1. Start from a clean integration worktree on the repo’s primary integration
   branch and sync it with origin when the repo policy expects that.
2. Create a dedicated branch from that clean integration baseline.
3. Create a dedicated worktree for the branch instead of implementing in the
   integration checkout.
4. If the change spans repos, create a matching branch worktree in each repo.
5. Create or refresh the durable plan and the `.plan.toml` manifest.
6. Load only the current phase, the relevant code, and the required ledgers.
7. Implement only the current phase.
8. Run the phase checker against the current phase.
9. Update required docs, optional completion logs, mirrors, and any published
   maps required by that phase.
10. Re-run the phase checker.
11. Advance only when the phase is green.
12. Merge only after acceptance and final-green closure.

## Final Git Checkpoint

Before reporting implementation work as `ready for review`, `complete`,
`passed`, or an equivalent terminal state, prove the branch contains the
reviewable result.

The final checkpoint requires:

- `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` is empty in the implementation
  worktree
- `HEAD` is ahead of the baseline branch or commit recorded in the plan and
  manifest
- the final answer, job result, or completion log states `branch`, `commit`,
  `pushed: yes/no`, and `worktree_clean: true/false`

If durable source, doc, schema, or config changes remain uncommitted at final
response time, the result is `failed_gate`. Do not report dirty implementation
work as ready for review, and do not downgrade it to a degraded completion.

The final implementation or closeout phase should normally include both:

```toml
[[phases.implementation.checks]]
id = "repo-clean"
type = "git_clean"
repo = "."

[[phases.implementation.checks]]
id = "head-ahead-of-baseline"
type = "git_head_ahead"
repo = "."
```

## Clean Git Closeout

When the operator asks to "clean git", do not treat that as generic pruning.
Treat it as a reconciliation pass that must end every non-main branch in one of
these dispositions:

1. merge to `main`, push, then remove the related branch and worktree
2. promote pending proposal artifacts onto `main` without leaving a live
   implementation branch behind
3. keep the branch active because substantive implementation is still in
   progress
4. discard or supersede the branch after recording the decision durably

Use the reconciliation inventory first:

```bash
python3 agent-protocols/scripts/workstream.py reconcile --json
```

The reconciliation output should compare every live branch and dirty worktree
against `main`, summarize the remaining path-level deltas, and recommend which
disposition each stream should take.

Completed or proposal-ready work should be promoted into `main` rather than
left on side branches. Historical or safety refs should remain exceptional and
explicitly named as preserved history, not as default residue from ordinary
closeout.

A clean closeout should leave the integration worktree back on a clean
`main`, with obsolete branch worktrees removed instead of lingering as
ambiguous truth.

Once the branch result is committed on `origin/main` and the remote checkpoint
exists, delete the local branch and remove its dedicated worktree unless there
is an explicit reason to preserve them.

If follow-up work is needed later, create a new branch from `main` or from the
relevant merge commit instead of treating the old implementation branch as
durable infrastructure.

## Map Refresh At Closeout

If a substantive workstream changes any surface described by the published
maps, update the published system, documentation, and test-coverage maps before
calling the workstream accepted or complete.

That usually means the repo-local `docs/system-map.md`,
`docs/documentation-map.md`, and `docs/test-coverage-map.md`, plus any relevant
`docs/cross-repo/*` or sibling product-map variants.

Do not churn the maps for work that clearly does not change any mapped surface.

## Naming And Namespace Conventions

Use one stable feature or initiative slug across branches, worktrees, plan
basenames, and temp docs when the workstream has a clear center of gravity.

Recommended patterns:

- branches:
  - `feature/<feature-slug>/<slice>-YYYY-MM-DD`
  - `docs/<feature-slug>/<slice>-YYYY-MM-DD`
- worktree directories:
  - `<repo>-<feature-slug>-<slice>`
- temp docs:
  - `docs/temp/<feature-slug>/<topic>-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

Examples:

- `feature/agent-protocols/temp-doc-governance-2026-03-30`
- `docs/agent-protocols/temp-doc-governance-2026-03-30`
- `docs/temp/agent-protocols/topology-clarification-2026-03-29.md`

This reduces branch and worktree sprawl by making related slices visually
group together instead of creating many flat one-off names.

## Current-State Ledger

If the repo keeps a live current-state audit, keep one generated repo-local
ledger such as `docs/live-workstream-status.md`.

Do not collapse live mutable branch state into the canonical planning protocol.
The plans landing page, plans index, and live-state ledger have different jobs.

That generated ledger should always be derived from git and worktree
inspection, not hand-maintained from narrative memory.

Pending proposals should appear there as pending proposals. Branchless plan
manifests should appear as branchless plan manifests: manifest-backed plan
families whose recorded branch is not currently present locally, but which are
not automatically proposals.

Active implementation work should appear as live branches. Completed
implementation should stop being represented as a live workstream once the
branch cleanup is finished.

## Archive And History

Keep these roles distinct:

- `docs/plans/archive/` for historical, promoted, superseded, or parked plan
  families, including their manifests, completion logs, and phase notes
- `docs/history/` for factual ledgers, preserved audits, migration notes,
  branch snapshots, and postmortems

Use `archive` when the artifact is still fundamentally a plan family. Use
`history` when the artifact is a factual record of what happened.

## Context Hygiene

For large streams, the active context should be:

- the current phase doc
- the current manifest
- only the code and specs needed for that phase
- only the review or ledger sections that the phase must update

Do not keep the entire epic live in context if the current phase can be proven
with a smaller working set.

## Checker Contract

Use the canonical checker:

```bash
python3 agent-protocols/scripts/check_gated_plan.py path/to/work.plan.toml --phase phase_name
```

Supported check types are illustrated in:

- [gated-phase-manifest.example.toml](examples/gated-phase-manifest.example.toml)

## Minimal Manifest Shape

The manifest is TOML so it can be parsed with the Python standard library.

Use:

- top-level `title`
- optional `branch`
- optional `root_dir`
- ordered `phase_order`
- one `[phases.<name>]` table per phase
- `depends_on` where needed
- one or more `[[phases.<name>.checks]]`

Supported check types:

- `path_exists`
- `path_absent`
- `text_present`
- `text_absent`
- `regex_present`
- `regex_absent`
- `command`
- `git_clean`
- `git_head_ahead`
- `git_merged_into`
- `git_ref_equals`
- `git_branch_absent`
- `worktree_absent`

## Branch Rule

This rule is mandatory for substantive work:

- do not continue new implementation on whatever branch happened to be checked
  out when the request arrived
- do not treat a dirty `main` worktree as the normal staging ground for new
  implementation
- create a fresh dedicated branch for the new workstream
- keep the integration branch worktree clean and reasonably up to date with the
  remote integration branch
- create a dedicated worktree for that branch instead of reusing a checkout
  that already mixes multiple streams
- if the work spans repos, create a matching branch pair
- keep a stable integration worktree available for bootstrap paths, pulls,
  merges, pushes, and reconciliation

Planning-system changes are not exempt.

## Merge Rule

The intended lifecycle is:

1. branch from the integration baseline
2. implement behind gated phases
3. accept the work
4. merge back to the integration baseline
5. push the promoted result until the branch outcome is present on `origin/main`
   when the repo policy expects a remote checkpoint
6. once the promoted result is on `origin/main`, remove the branch worktree and
   delete the local branch unless it is explicitly preserved
7. if future work is needed, branch again from `main` or from the merge commit
   instead of reviving the old implementation branch

If a workstream is parked, superseded, or intentionally left partial, record
that in the durable plan instead of silently leaving the branch as ambiguous
truth.
